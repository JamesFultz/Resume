I have been working as a field technician for over 20 years. During that time I have focused heavily on
embedded software, electronics and troubleshooting. Support and development of technology is the next step in
my career. I really love field work but I want to work remotely and in development. Travel is expected at 25% of
the time for in person troubleshooting or operations. I have real life experience getting a job done with physical
and digital tools in a field environment. Learning through solving problems with others as a teammate, patience
and dedication are my greatest strengths. As a Marine Corps Veteran I can lead by example, follow detailed
instructions and work well under pressure. I want to work for a company to support and develop technology. I
am well versed in skillsets and want to grow as a problem solver.
